# Academic-Probation-System
We built and implemented an academic probation system for the University of Technology in Jamaica as part of a collaborative Artificial Intelligence project. The system, built with Prolog and Python, calculates students' cumulative GPAs, sends notifications to stakeholders, and manages the student database.
